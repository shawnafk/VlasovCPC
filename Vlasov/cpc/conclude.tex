\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:end}
In summary, we have developed a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method tailored for the resonance tracking Vlasov system. This method effectively segregates the perturbed wave-particle interactions within the fast-varying Hamiltonian phase space, while simultaneously advancing Lagrangian markers within the slowly varying Hamiltonian phase space. To validate its efficacy, we conducted several simulations focusing on the whistler mode chorus in the Earth's magnetosphere. The results not only exhibit strong agreement with prior findings but also offer a higher-resolution portrayal of the resonant particle phase space.
The implications of this research are profound, spanning a spectrum of scientific disciplines, including fusion research, space physics, and astrophysics. This advancement in our understanding of nonlinear wave-particle interactions within inhomogeneous magnetic fields holds the potential to revolutionize our capacity to control and manipulate plasma behavior. This, in turn, can pave the way for progress in energy generation, propulsion, and space exploration. Thus, this paper represents a pivotal milestone in unlocking the untapped potential of nonlinear plasma physics within complex magnetic field environments.
