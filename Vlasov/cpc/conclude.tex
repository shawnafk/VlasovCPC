\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:end}
In summary, we developed a hybrid-Lagrangian-Eulerian method for the resonance tracking Vlasov system. The method separatly solves the pertubed wave particle interaction in fast-varying Hamiltonian subspace, while push the Lagrangian marker in the slowly varying Hamiltonian subspace. 
We run several simulations for the whistler mode chorus in the Earth magnetosphere for benchmark. The result not only show good agreement with previous results, it also shows high resolution results of the resonant particle phase space.
The outcomes of this research promise far-reaching implications across various scientific disciplines, including fusion research, space physics, and astrophysics. A more precise grasp of nonlinear wave-particle interactions in inhomogeneous magnetic fields could pave the way for enhanced control and manipulation of plasma behavior, enabling advancements in energy generation, propulsion, and space exploration. This paper thus serves as a pivotal stepping stone towards unlocking the untapped potential of nonlinear plasma physics in complex magnetic field environments.
