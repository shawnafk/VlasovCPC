\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:end}
In summary, we have developed a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method tailored for the resonance tracking Vlasov system
for the understanding of nonlinear resonant wave-particle interactions in inhomogeneous magnetic fields. This method effectively separates the perturbed wave-particle interactions within the fast varying Hamiltonian phase space while  advancing Lagrangian markers within the slowly varying Hamiltonian phase space. To validate the method, we have conducted self-consistent simulations focusing on the whistler-mode chorus in the Earth's magnetosphere  using realistic parameters. The results not only exhibit  agreement with the linear prediction  but also reveal high-resolution phase space structures of resonant energetic particles.
%The implications of this research are profound, spanning a spectrum of scientific disciplines, including fusion research, space physics, and astrophysics. This advancement in our understanding of nonlinear wave-particle interactions within inhomogeneous magnetic fields holds the potential to revolutionize our capacity to control and manipulate plasma behavior. This, in turn, can pave the way for progress in energy generation, propulsion, and space exploration. Thus, this paper represents a pivotal milestone in unlocking the untapped potential of nonlinear plasma physics within complex magnetic field environments.
